아 지루하다
아 재미 없다
아 하기 싫다
아 의미 없다
다 때려 치우고 집에 가고 싶다
침대에서 뒹굴뒹굴 고양이랑 놀고 싶다
피자나 한 판 시켜 놓고 테레비나 보고 싶다
집에 가고 싶다 집에 가고 싶다
아 피곤하다
아 배고프다
아 재수없다
아 꼴 보기 싫다
다 때려 치우고 집에 가고 싶다
침대에서 뒹굴뒹굴 고양이랑 놀고 싶다
피자나 한 판 시켜 놓고 테레비나 보고 싶다
집에 가고 싶다 집에 가고 싶다
뜨거운 물로 샤워하고 맥주나 마시고 싶다
봤던 영화 틀어놓고 멍 때리고 싶다
그러다 스르르 잠이 들어 늦잠 자고 싶다
집에 가고 싶다 집에 가고 싶다
집에 가고싶다
집에 가고싶다
집에 가고싶다
집에 가고싶다

    'Cause I-I-I'm in the stars tonight
So watch me bring the fire and set the night alight
Shoes on, get up in the morn'
Cup of milk, let's rock and roll
King Kong, kick the drum, rolling on like a Rolling Stone
Sing song when I'm walking home
Jump up to the top, LeBron
Ding dong, call me on my phone
Ice tea and a game of ping pong, huh
This is getting heavy
Can you hear the bass boom? I'm ready (woo hoo)
Life is sweet as honey
Yeah, this beat cha-ching like money, huh
Disco overload, I'm into that, I'm good to go
I'm diamond, you know I glow up
Hey, so let's go
'Cause I-I-I'm in the stars tonight
So watch me bring the fire and set the night alight (hey)
Shining through the city with a little funk and soul
So I'ma light it up like dynamite, whoa oh oh
Bring a friend, join the crowd
Whoever wanna come along
Word up, talk the talk
Just move like we off the wall
Day or night, the sky's alight
So we dance to the break of dawn
Ladies and gentlemen, I got the medicine
So you should keep ya eyes on the ball, huh
This is getting heavy
Can you hear the bass boom? I'm ready (woo hoo)
Life is sweet as honey
Yeah, this beat cha-ching like money
Disco overload, I'm into that, I'm good to go
I'm diamond, you know I glow up
Let's go
'Cause I-I-I'm in the stars tonight
So watch me bring the fire and set the night alight (hey)
Shining through the city with a little funk and soul
So I'ma light it up like dynamite, whoa oh oh
Dy-na-na-na, na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na, life is dynamite
Dy-na-na-na, na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na, life is dynamite
Shining through the city with a little funk and soul
So I'ma light it up like dynamite, whoa oh oh
Dy-na-na-na, na-na, na-na, ayy
Dy-na-na-na, na-na, na-na, ayy
Dy-na-na-na, na-na, na-na, ayy
Light it up like dynamite
Dy-na-na-na, na-na, na-na, ayy
Dy-na-na-na, na-na, na-na, ayy
Dy-na-na-na, na-na, na-na, ayy
Light it up like dynamite
'Cause I-I-I'm in the stars tonight
So watch me bring the fire and set the night alight
Shining through the city with a little funk and soul
So I'ma light it up like dynamite (this is ah)
'Cause I-I-I'm in the stars tonight
So watch me bring the fire and set the night alight (alight, oh)
Shining through the city with a little funk and soul
So I'ma light it up like dynamite, whoa (light it up like dynamite)
Dy-na-na-na, na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na, life is dynamite
Dy-na-na-na, na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na, life is dynamite
Shining through the city with a little funk and soul

<h3 id="song3">2002</h3>
<pre> I will always remember
    The day you kissed my lips
    Light as a feather
    And it went just like this
    No, it's never been better
    Than the summer of 2002 (ooh)
    Uh, we were only eleven
    But acting like grown-ups
    Like we are in the present
    Drinking from plastic cups
    Singing, "Love is forever and ever"
    Well, I guess that was true
    Dancing on the hood in the middle of the woods
    On an old Mustang, where we sang
    Songs with all our childhood friends
    And it went like this, say
    Oops, I got 99 problems singing bye, bye, bye
    Hold up, if you wanna go and take a ride with me
    Better hit me, baby, one more time, uh
    Paint a picture for you and me
    On the days when we were young, uh
    Singing at the top of both our lungs
    Now we're under the covers
    Fast forward to eighteen
    We are more than lovers
    Yeah, we are all we need
    When we're holding each other
    I'm taken back to 2002 (ooh)
    Yeah
    Dancing on the hood in the middle of the woods
    On an old Mustang, where we sang
    Songs with all our childhood friends
    And it went like this, say
    Oops, I got 99 problems singing bye, bye, bye
    Hold up, if you wanna go and take a ride with me
    Better hit me, baby, one more time, uh
    Paint a picture for you and me
    On the days when we were young, uh
    Singing at the top of both our lungs
    On the day we fell in love
    Ooh ooh, ooh ooh
    On the day we fell in love
    Ooh ooh, ooh ooh
    Dancing on the hood in the middle of the woods
    On an old Mustang, where we sang
    Songs with all our childhood friends
    Oh, now
    Oops, I got 99 problems singing bye, bye, bye
    Hold up, if you wanna go and take a ride with me
    Better hit me, baby, one more time
    Paint a picture for you and me
    On the days when we were young
    Singing at the top of both our lungs
    On the day we fell in love
    Ooh ooh, ooh ooh
    On the day we fell in love
    Ooh ooh, ooh ooh
    On the day we fell in love
    Ooh ooh, ooh ooh
    On the day we fell in love
    Ooh ooh, ooh ooh
    On the day we fell in love, love, love</pre>
